I&amp;rsquo;m used to my estimates being wrong. It turns out that &lt;a class="link" href="http://barque.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Barque Smokehouse&lt;/a> has the same problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We showed up at 7pm knowing that they were pretty busy. We had called earlier to make a reservation and couldn&amp;rsquo;t get one, so we weren&amp;rsquo;t surprised to end up on a waiting list. It started off well, because they took my cell phone number and said they&amp;rsquo;d call when a spot at the bar was available. I like it when a restaurant will call you to let you know they&amp;rsquo;re ready. The failure started with the initial estimate: 1.5 hours. It was going to be a long wait, but we thought 8:30 would be reasonable. We went up the street to drink at &lt;a class="link" href="http://thedizzy.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>The Dizzy&lt;/a> which is pleasant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At 8:30, I called back. The new estimate was &amp;ldquo;about 20 to 25 more minutes.&amp;rdquo; At 9:00, I called back. The new estimate was &amp;ldquo;about 20 to 25 minutes.&amp;rdquo; At this point, our optimism crushed, we decided to stay at the Dizzy and eat. Barque finally called back at 9:30pm, but we gave up our spot on the waiting list.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So in the end, we expected an hour and half wait&amp;ndash;we got two and half hours. We might try Barque again at some point, but we won&amp;rsquo;t be trying their waiting list.&lt;/p>
