&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s where I&amp;rsquo;m going to dump my thoughts about:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>software&lt;/li>
&lt;li>karate&lt;/li>
&lt;li>kids&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sailing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>cooking&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently become interested in how SEO works, so I&amp;rsquo;m also going to try to SEO the heck out of this site, at least from a WordPress tooling perspective. I don&amp;rsquo;t expect this site to rank particularly highly on any particular keyword since it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a general mishmash. But I&amp;rsquo;ve already learned how to hook up Google Analytics and Google Webmaster Tools. The WordPress plugin I&amp;rsquo;m using is the &amp;ldquo;All in One SEO Pack&amp;rdquo;, which in addition to guiding me through the Google process, also helped me end up with:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A sitemap.xml&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Verifying the site with Bing and Pinterest as well as Google.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Including a reference to my Google+ account (we&amp;rsquo;ll see if that shows up properly in the search results later).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The other WordPress Plugins I&amp;rsquo;ve installed so far are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Defensio Anti-spam. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how much garbage ends up in the comments. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave them turned on for now.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Google Analyticator, which may be unnecessary in conjunction with the &amp;ldquo;All in One SEO Pack&amp;rdquo;, but provides a view of Google Analytics embedded in the WordPress dashboard.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>WP Super Cache to speed up the site. I noticed that when I changed the theme, I had to invalidate (delete) the cache.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As for WordPress itself, until recently I had a pretty low opinion of it. I&amp;rsquo;ve ended up mis-using it as a wiki at work, and it really doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit the bill. I&amp;rsquo;ve found it sluggish, and a pain to create hierarchical content. However, the availability of plugins is amazing and the editing experience seems good so far, for a single article-style blog entry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let the experiment begin.&lt;/p>
