Before I retired my obvious email address @benhall.ca due to over-spam, I&amp;rsquo;d get a helpful email from him every few weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The more things change, the more they stay the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On Twitter, I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/benhall" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>@BenHall&lt;/a>. For a while now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting mis-tweeted by a bunch of people who are looking for other Ben Halls. More entertainingly, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned about the &lt;a class="link" href="http://goo.gl/maps/qYm9w" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>town of Benhall in England&lt;/a>. For instance, Rebecca is exhorting the youth to do something with torches in a tweet where she probably should have used #benhall as opposed to @Benhall:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve also learned about the 2013 Houston mayoral race where a Ben Hall hopes to unseat the incumbent:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Speaking of being caught in a mayoral blast radius, at least I&amp;rsquo;m not this poor Rob Ford from Manchester:&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>As I mentioned in my previous post, while setting the blog up with SEO plugins, I also configured it for Google Analytics. As I was monitoring the site dashboard for any hint that someone other than me has visited benhall.ca, I saw an unexplained visit. From the US. From Houston. It turns out that someone did a search on Yahoo, for &amp;ldquo;ben hall&amp;rdquo;, using Safari on an iPhone at around 7am (which time zone?) So&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To you Gentle Reader from Houston (you know who you are), I assume you were looking for &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.benhallformayor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>this Ben Hall&lt;/a>. I hope you weren&amp;rsquo;t too disappointed. But since you were here, how did the site look on your iPhone? Responsive enough? And are you satisfied with Comcast as your Internet provider? Listen&amp;hellip;if you think it&amp;rsquo;s creepy that I know this much about your visit, I agree. Google Analytics is creepy. And I haven&amp;rsquo;t even turned on the full demographic info.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet.&lt;/p>
