I just signed the petition at [No Jets TO](http://www.nojetsto.ca/). I found the infographics a pretty good summary of the arguments against the airport expansion.

The one that I find most compelling is the reminder that the train link to Pearson is coming soon and will offer the same travel time as many other big cities' train links and in many cases a faster travel time.
