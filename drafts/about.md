I'm Ben Hall, a software engineer and technical director at Intelliware with expertise in Java and agile development methods.

This site is where I share my thoughts about software development, karate, kids, sailing, and cooking. I've been writing here since 2013, though the technology behind the site has evolved from WordPress to Jekyll and now to Hugo.

When I'm not coding or writing, you can find me:
- Practicing karate
- Sailing on Lake Ontario
- Cooking for my family
- Exploring the outdoors
