>work&lt;/a> about &lt;a class="link" href="http://i-proving.com/2014/04/29/non-functional-requirements-are-underappreciated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>non-functional requirements&lt;/a> (&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->NFRs&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->). It&amp;rsquo;s a dry topic, but one that I&amp;rsquo;m quite interested in. Sadly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing I struggled with was the impact that an awful name has on a concept. The name &amp;ldquo;non-functional&amp;rdquo; makes the concept very slippery. Not only does it fail to signify the importance of the idea, it seems to have the opposite effect of forcing it out of the mind. Terms like &amp;ldquo;application requirements&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;system requirements&amp;rdquo; are better substitutes for &amp;ldquo;functional&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;non-functional&amp;rdquo; because they suggest that those requirements are orthogonal to each other and don&amp;rsquo;t oppose each other.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, as dysfunctional as it is, &amp;ldquo;non-functional&amp;rdquo; seems to be the accepted term.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rail Link Beats Toronto Island Airport Expansion</title><link>https://benhall.ca/post/2013-12-03-rail-link-beats-toronto-island-airport-expansion/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2013 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://benhall.ca/post/2013-12-03-rail-link-beats-toronto-island-airport-expansion/</guid><description>&lt;p>I just signed the petition at &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.nojetsto.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

I&amp;rsquo;m used to my estimates being wrong. It turns out that &lt;a class="link" href="http://barque.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Barque Smokehouse&lt;/a> has the same problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We showed up at 7pm knowing that they were pretty busy. We had called earlier to make a reservation and couldn&amp;rsquo;t get one, so we weren&amp;rsquo;t surprised to end up on a waiting list. It started off well, because they took my cell phone number and said they&amp;rsquo;d call when a spot at the bar was available. I like it when a restaurant will call you to let you know they&amp;rsquo;re ready. The failure started with the initial estimate: 1.5 hours. It was going to be a long wait, but we thought 8:30 would be reasonable. We went up the street to drink at &lt;a class="link" href="http://thedizzy.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>The Dizzy&lt;/a> which is pleasant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At 8:30, I called back. The new estimate was &amp;ldquo;about 20 to 25 more minutes.&amp;rdquo; At 9:00, I called back. The new estimate was &amp;ldquo;about 20 to 25 minutes.&amp;rdquo; At this point, our optimism crushed, we decided to stay at the Dizzy and eat. Barque finally called back at 9:30pm, but we gave up our spot on the waiting list.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So in the end, we expected an hour and half wait&amp;ndash;we got two and half hours. We might try Barque again at some point, but we won&amp;rsquo;t be trying their waiting list.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="get-set-up-on-pinterest-for-business">Get Set up on Pinterest for Business
&lt;/h2>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Go to &lt;a class="link" href="http://business.pinterest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Pinterest for Business&lt;/a> and click on &amp;ldquo;Join as a Business&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fill out the &amp;ldquo;Create a Business Account&amp;rdquo; form:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I selected &amp;ldquo;Other&amp;rdquo; as the business type;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You need to choose an email address that doesn&amp;rsquo;t already have an account with Pinterest. I ended up using my gmail account so I used the &amp;ldquo;+&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;generate&amp;rdquo; a new email address. Meaning, if my email address at gmail.com was &lt;code>foo@gmail.com&lt;/code>, I used &lt;code>foo+sailinghall@gmail.com&lt;/code>. Pinterest recognized it as a separate email address, but gmail directs emails to &lt;code>foo+sailinghall@gmail.com&lt;/code> to the regular &lt;code>foo@gmail.com&lt;/code> address.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I filled in username, business name, and website all as expected, and left the rest of the fields alone.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Go to your email account and confirm your email address following the directions in the email.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="confirm-your-website">Confirm Your Website
&lt;/h2>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Back at Pinterest, click on your account name in the upper right, and select Settings from the menu.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click on Edit Profile.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click on Verify Website (the name of the website should already have been filled in from your &amp;ldquo;Create a Business Account&amp;rdquo; page earlier.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click on Verify with a meta tag.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Copy the value in the content attribute to your clipboard.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In other tab, log in to your WordPress admin account. From the dashboard menu on the left select &amp;ldquo;All in One SEO Pack&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;General Settings&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Scroll down to &amp;ldquo;Pinterest Site Verification&amp;rdquo; under &amp;ldquo;Webmaster Verification&amp;rdquo; and paste the code that you copied from Pinterest.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Scroll down to the bottom and click &amp;ldquo;Update Options&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After the WordPress settings are saved, go back to your Pinterest tab, and click &amp;ldquo;Complete Verification&amp;rdquo;. Interestingly, there&amp;rsquo;s no feedback if this is successful, but if you click &amp;ldquo;Complete Verification&amp;rdquo; a second time, it will tell you that the site has already been verified. Click on the X to dismiss the Verify Your Website dialog.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>While saving my &amp;ldquo;Profile&amp;rdquo;, I had to fix the website name to include &amp;ldquo;http://&amp;rdquo; in front of the website name. The &amp;ldquo;Create a Business Account&amp;rsquo; page had stripped the http:// that I originally added.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Back on the Pinterest Account Settings page, there are a lot of options to associate your Pinterest account with many other social networks. I suppose this makes sense, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t done it myself. It reminds me to think about my social networking strategy though.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Setting Up Defensio Anti-spam in Wordpress</title><link>https://benhall.ca/post/2013-11-11-setting-up-defensio-anti-spam-in-wordpress/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2013 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://benhall.ca/post/2013-11-11-setting-up-defensio-anti-spam-in-wordpress/</guid><description>&lt;p>After installing &amp;ldquo;All in One SEO&amp;rdquo; pack, getting Google Analytics set up, and registering my site with Google Webmaster Tools and Bing Webmaster Tools (and Pinterest), the next thing to do is install the &amp;ldquo;Defensio Anti-spam&amp;rdquo; plugin in Wordpress. This involves getting a free account with Defensio, which is where we&amp;rsquo;ll start, and installing the plugin and then confirming the API key within the plugin.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="defensio-account">Defensio Account
&lt;/h2>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Go to &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.defensio.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Defensio Anti-spam&lt;/a> and set up a new account.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click on &amp;ldquo;My API Keys&amp;rdquo; and select &amp;ldquo;Protect another web property&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Choose &amp;ldquo;Protect a Blog or Website&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enter your site&amp;rsquo;s URL and click Submit.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Copy your API key to the clipboard.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="install-the-plugin">Install the Plugin
&lt;/h2>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Go back to your site&amp;rsquo;s WordPress Dashboard and select Plugins &amp;gt; Add New.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Search for &amp;ldquo;Defensio&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Select &amp;ldquo;Defensio Anti-Spam&amp;rdquo; and click on &amp;ldquo;Install Now&amp;rdquo; and confirm in the dialog.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click on Activate Plugin.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You&amp;rsquo;ll see a message that says &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>Defensio is not active&lt;/strong> because you have not entered your Defensio API key. &lt;a class="link" href="http://defensio.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Get one right here!&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; You&amp;rsquo;ve already got an API key, so go to the left hand menu. Select Plugins &amp;gt; Defensio Configuration&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click &amp;ldquo;Save Settings&amp;rdquo;, leaving all the other options alone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You should get a message saying that your API key is valid.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now that the plugin is installed, you&amp;rsquo;ll see an extra menu item under Comments for &amp;ldquo;Defensio Spam&amp;rdquo; where you can confirm or release comments that are identified as spam.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Setting up All In One SEO Pack</title><link>https://benhall.ca/post/2013-11-08-setting-up-all-in-one-seo-pack/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2013 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://benhall.ca/post/2013-11-08-setting-up-all-in-one-seo-pack/</guid><description>&lt;p>WordPress has a freely available plugin called &amp;ldquo;All in One SEO Pack&amp;rdquo;. This plugin helps with SEO good practices like:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>hooking your site up to Google Webmaster Tools, Bing Webmaster Tools, and registering with Pinterest;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>setting up Google Analytics;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>creating a sitemap.xml;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>referring to your Google+ account.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Here are the steps I&amp;rsquo;ve used to set up &amp;ldquo;All in One SEO Pack&amp;rdquo; v2.0.4.1 on my latest site running on a self-hosting install of WordPress 3.7.1. Bear in mind that the Google and Bing webmaster instructions were good as of the date that I wrote this.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Log in as an administrator and select Plugins &amp;gt; Add New which takes you to the Install Plugins screen.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Search for &amp;ldquo;All in One SEO Pack&amp;rdquo; which should be the first result.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click Install Now and then OK.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On the screen labelled &amp;ldquo;Installing Plugin: All in One SEO Pack 2.0.4.1&amp;rdquo;, click &amp;ldquo;Activate Plugin&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the top of the left-side menu towards, you should have a new entry called &amp;ldquo;All in One SEO&amp;rdquo;. Click on it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can dismiss the helpful &amp;ldquo;Welcome&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Review Your Settings&amp;rdquo; pop-ups by clicking &amp;ldquo;Dismiss&amp;rdquo; in each one&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll start off with the General Settings:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In &amp;ldquo;Home Page Settings&amp;rdquo;, set your Home Title, Home Description, and Home Keywords. These will controls the settings only your home page. Choosing well here is important, but is beyond my to give good advice on. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry too much&amp;ndash;these can be updated later.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In &amp;ldquo;Keyword Settings&amp;rdquo;:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Leave &amp;ldquo;Use Keywords&amp;rdquo; enabled.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Turn on &amp;ldquo;Use Categories for META Keywords&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leave &amp;ldquo;Use Tags for META Keywords&amp;rdquo; enabled.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leave &amp;ldquo;Dynamically generate Keywords for Posts pages&amp;rdquo; enabled.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leave all the &amp;ldquo;Title Settings&amp;rdquo; as-is.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leave &amp;ldquo;Custom Site Post Settings&amp;rdquo; as-is.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leave &amp;ldquo;Display Settings&amp;rdquo; as-is.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leave the &amp;ldquo;Noindex Settings&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Advanced Settings&amp;rdquo; (at the bottom of the page) as they are.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>At this point, use the &amp;ldquo;Update Options&amp;rdquo; button at the bottom and then scroll back down to the settings for &amp;ldquo;Webmaster Verification.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Google Webmaster Tools&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In a new browser tab, go to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Google Webmaster Tools&lt;/a>, using your Google Account.&lt;/li>

Before I retired my obvious email address @benhall.ca due to over-spam, I&amp;rsquo;d get a helpful email from him every few weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The more things change, the more they stay the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On Twitter, I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/benhall" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>@BenHall&lt;/a>. For a while now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting mis-tweeted by a bunch of people who are looking for other Ben Halls. More entertainingly, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned about the &lt;a class="link" href="http://goo.gl/maps/qYm9w" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>town of Benhall in England&lt;/a>. For instance, Rebecca is exhorting the youth to do something with torches in a tweet where she probably should have used #benhall as opposed to @Benhall:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve also learned about the 2013 Houston mayoral race where a Ben Hall hopes to unseat the incumbent:&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="a-shout-out-to-my-american-readers">A shout out to my American readers
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>As I mentioned in my previous post, while setting the blog up with SEO plugins, I also configured it for Google Analytics. As I was monitoring the site dashboard for any hint that someone other than me has visited benhall.ca, I saw an unexplained visit. From the US. From Houston. It turns out that someone did a search on Yahoo, for &amp;ldquo;ben hall&amp;rdquo;, using Safari on an iPhone at around 7am (which time zone?) So&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To you Gentle Reader from Houston (you know who you are), I assume you were looking for &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.benhallformayor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>this Ben Hall&lt;/a>. I hope you weren&amp;rsquo;t too disappointed. But since you were here, how did the site look on your iPhone? Responsive enough? And are you satisfied with Comcast as your Internet provider? Listen&amp;hellip;if you think it&amp;rsquo;s creepy that I know this much about your visit, I agree. Google Analytics is creepy. And I haven&amp;rsquo;t even turned on the full demographic info.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s where I&amp;rsquo;m going to dump my thoughts about:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>software&lt;/li>
&lt;li>karate&lt;/li>
&lt;li>kids&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sailing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>cooking&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently become interested in how SEO works, so I&amp;rsquo;m also going to try to SEO the heck out of this site, at least from a WordPress tooling perspective. I don&amp;rsquo;t expect this site to rank particularly highly on any particular keyword since it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a general mishmash. But I&amp;rsquo;ve already learned how to hook up Google Analytics and Google Webmaster Tools. The WordPress plugin I&amp;rsquo;m using is the &amp;ldquo;All in One SEO Pack&amp;rdquo;, which in addition to guiding me through the Google process, also helped me end up with:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A sitemap.xml&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Verifying the site with Bing and Pinterest as well as Google.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Including a reference to my Google+ account (we&amp;rsquo;ll see if that shows up properly in the search results later).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The other WordPress Plugins I&amp;rsquo;ve installed so far are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Defensio Anti-spam. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how much garbage ends up in the comments. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave them turned on for now.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Google Analyticator, which may be unnecessary in conjunction with the &amp;ldquo;All in One SEO Pack&amp;rdquo;, but provides a view of Google Analytics embedded in the WordPress dashboard.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>WP Super Cache to speed up the site. I noticed that when I changed the theme, I had to invalidate (delete) the cache.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As for WordPress itself, until recently I had a pretty low opinion of it. I&amp;rsquo;ve ended up mis-using it as a wiki at work, and it really doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit the bill. I&amp;rsquo;ve found it sluggish, and a pain to create hierarchical content. However, the availability of plugins is amazing and the editing experience seems good so far, for a single article-style blog entry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let the experiment begin.&lt;/p>
