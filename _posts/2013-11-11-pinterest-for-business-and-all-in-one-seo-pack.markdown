The two main steps are to create a Pinterest for Businsess account, and then confirm your website.

## Get Set up on Pinterest for Business

- Go to <a title="Pinterest for Business" href="http://business.pinterest.com/">http://business.pinterest.com/</a> and click on &#8220;Join as a Business&#8221;
- Fill out the &#8220;Create a Business Account&#8221; form:
	+ I selected &#8220;Other&#8221; as the business type;
	+ You need to choose an email address that doesn&#8217;t already have an account with Pinterest. I ended up using my gmail account so I used the &#8220;+&#8221; to &#8220;generate&#8221; a new email address. Meaning, if my email address at gmail.com was `foo@gmail.com`, I used `foo+sailinghall@gmail.com`. Pinterest recognized it as a separate email address, but gmail directs emails to `foo+sailinghall@gmail.com` to the regular `foo@gmail.com` address.
	+ I filled in username, business name, and website all as expected, and left the rest of the fields alone.
- Go to your email account and confirm your email address following the directions in the email.

## Confirm Your Website

- Back at Pinterest, click on your account name in the upper right, and select Settings from the menu.
- Click on Edit Profile.
- Click on Verify Website (the name of the website should already have been filled in from your &#8220;Create a Business Account&#8221; page earlier.
- Click on Verify with a meta tag.
- Copy the value in the content attribute to your clipboard.
- In other tab, log in to your WordPress admin account. From the dashboard menu on the left select &#8220;All in One SEO Pack&#8221; and &#8220;General Settings&#8221;.
- Scroll down to &#8220;Pinterest Site Verification&#8221; under &#8220;Webmaster Verification&#8221; and paste the code that you copied from Pinterest.
- Scroll down to the bottom and click &#8220;Update Options&#8221;
- After the WordPress settings are saved, go back to your Pinterest tab, and click &#8220;Complete Verification&#8221;. Interestingly, there&#8217;s no feedback if this is successful, but if you click &#8220;Complete Verification&#8221; a second time, it will tell you that the site has already been verified. Click on the X to dismiss the Verify Your Website dialog.
- While saving my &#8220;Profile&#8221;, I had to fix the website name to include &#8220;http://&#8221; in front of the website name. The &#8220;Create a Business Account&#8217; page had stripped the http:// that I originally added.

Back on the Pinterest Account Settings page, there are a lot of options to associate your Pinterest account with many other social networks. I suppose this makes sense, but I haven&#8217;t done it myself. It reminds me to think about my social networking strategy though.
