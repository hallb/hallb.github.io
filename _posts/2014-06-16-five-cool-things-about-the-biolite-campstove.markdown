Just got one of these for Fathers' Day: [BioLite CampStove](http://www.biolitestove.com/products/campstove/).

Five cool things about it:

1. Fire.
2. Built-in fan stokes fire.
3. Fire charges built-in fan.
4. Fire charges USB devices.
5. The company is building a model for distribution in developing countries.

And did I mention fire?
