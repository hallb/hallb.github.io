It's been a long time since the Ben over at [benhall.com](benhall.com) had to forward some email to me here at benhall.ca. Before I retired my obvious email address @benhall.ca due to over-spam, I'd get a helpful email from him every few weeks.

The more things change, the more they stay the same.

On Twitter, I'm <a title="@BenHall on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/benhall">@BenHall</a>. For a while now, I've been getting mis-tweeted by a bunch of people who are looking for other Ben Halls. More entertainingly, I've learned about the <a title="Map of Benhall in Suffolk" href="http://goo.gl/maps/qYm9w">town of Benhall in England</a>. For instance, Rebecca is exhorting the youth to do something with torches in a tweet where she probably should have used #benhall as opposed to @Benhall:

I've also learned about the 2013 Houston mayoral race where a Ben Hall hopes to unseat the incumbent:

Speaking of being caught in a mayoral blast radius, at least I'm not this poor Rob Ford from Manchester:

## A shout out to my American readers

As I mentioned in my previous post, while setting the blog up with SEO plugins, I also configured it for Google Analytics. As I was monitoring the site dashboard for any hint that someone other than me has visited benhall.ca, I saw an unexplained visit. From the US. From Houston. It turns out that someone did a search on Yahoo, for "ben hall", using Safari on an iPhone at around 7am (which time zone?) So...

To you Gentle Reader from Houston (you know who you are), I assume you were looking for <a title="Ben Hall Houston Mayoral Race 2013" href="http://www.benhallformayor.com/" target="_blank">this Ben Hall</a>. I hope you weren't too disappointed. But since you were here, how did the site look on your iPhone? Responsive enough? And are you satisfied with Comcast as your Internet provider? Listen...if you think it's creepy that I know this much about your visit, I agree. Google Analytics is creepy. And I haven't even turned on the full demographic info.

Yet.
