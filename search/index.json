WP Super Cache to speed up the site. I noticed that when I changed the theme, I had to invalidate (delete) the cache. As for WordPress itself, until recently I had a pretty low opinion of it. I\u0026rsquo;ve ended up mis-using it as a wiki at work, and it really doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit the bill. I\u0026rsquo;ve found it sluggish, and a pain to create hierarchical content.
