I'm Ben Hall, a software engineer and the Lead Technical Director at [Electric Mind](https://electricmind.com) (formerly Intelliware) where I provide trusted technical advice and deliver software projects with expertise in Java and agile development methods.

This site is where I share my thoughts about software development, karate, kids, sailing, and cooking.
